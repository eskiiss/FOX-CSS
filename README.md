# FOX CSS

A light Sass/CSS framework, built with the following things in mind:

* flexible template
* light resets
* HTML5 ready
* "mobile first" approach
* integration of border-box
* basic stylings
* inconsistency bugs fixes
* support for IE7+

The framework is very modular and can easily be customized according to specific needs.

## How to

Just include the CSS file in the `head` section of your document, like so:

    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="fox.css" />

## Sass version

Sass version of FOX CSS is composed of one main SCSS file and several partial files:

* _mixins.scss
* _reset.scss
* _formatting.scss
* _layout.scss
* _responsive-layout.scss
* _ie.scss

You can easily edit and remove the partials you don't need.
